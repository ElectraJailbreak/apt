apt (1.6~rc1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Seccomp sandboxing has been turned off by default for now. If it works
  for you, you are encouraged to re-enable it by setting APT::Sandbox::Seccomp
  to true.

apt (1.6~beta1) unstable; urgency=medium

  APT now verifies that the date of Release files is not in the future. By
  default, it may be 10 seconds in the future to allow for some clock drift.

  Two new configuration options can be used to tweak the behavior:
    Acquire::Check-Date
    Acquire::Max-DateFuture

  These can be overridden in sources.list entries using the check-date
  and date-future-max options. Note that disabling check-date also
  disables checks on valid-until: It is considered to mean that your
  machine's time is not reliable.

apt (1.6~alpha1) unstable; urgency=medium

  All methods provided by apt except for cdrom, gpgv, and rsh now
  use seccomp-BPF sandboxing to restrict the list of allowed system
  calls, and trap all others with a SIGSYS signal. Three options
  can be used to configure this further:

    APT::Sandbox::Seccomp is a boolean to turn it on/off
    APT::Sandbox::Seccomp::Trap is a list of names of more syscalls to trap
    APT::Sandbox::Seccomp::Allow is a list of names of more syscalls to allow

  Also, sandboxing is now enabled for the mirror method.

apt (1.5~beta1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ New HTTPS method ]
  The default http method now supports HTTPS itself, including encrypted proxies
  and connecting to HTTPS sites via HTTPS proxies; and the apt-transport-https
  package only provides a "curl+https" method now as a fallback, but will be
  removed shortly. If TLS support is unwanted, it can be disabled overall by
  setting the option Acquire::AllowTLS to "false".

  As for backwards compatibility, the options IssuerCert and SslForceVersion
  are not supported anymore, and any specified certificate files must be in the
  PEM format (curl might have allowed DER files as well).

  [ Changes to unauthenticated repositories ]
  The security exception for apt-get to only raise warnings if it encounters
  unauthenticated repositories in the "update" command is gone now, so that it
  will raise errors just like apt and all other apt-based front-ends do since
  at least apt version 1.3.

  It is possible (but STRONGLY ADVISED AGAINST) to revert to the previous
  behaviour of apt-get by setting the option
    Binary::apt-get::Acquire::AllowInsecureRepositories "true";
  See apt-secure(8) manpage for configuration details.

  [ Release Info Changes ]
  If values like Origin, Label, and Codename change in a Release file,
  update fails, or asks a user (if interactive). Various
  --allow-releaseinfo-change are provided for non-interactive use.

apt (1.4.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  If periodic updates and unattended upgrades are enabled, the start of
  periodic updates are now distributed over 24 hour intervals (as in 1.2
  to 1.4), whereas starting unattended-upgrade has been restricted to a
  time between 6 and 7 am. This only affects systems using systemd, other
  systems still use the classical hourly cron job.

apt (1.4~beta1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Support for GPG signatures using the SHA1 or RIPE-MD/160 hash
  algorithms has been disabled. Repositories using Release files
  signed in such a way will stop working. This change has been made
  due to security considerations, especially with regards to possible
  further breakthroughs in SHA1 breaking during the lifetime
  of this APT release series.

  It is possible (but STRONGLY ADVISED AGAINST) to revert to the previous
  behaviour by setting the options
    APT::Hashes::SHA1::Weak "yes";
    APT::Hashes::RIPE-MD/160::Weak "yes";
  Note that setting these options only affects the verification of the overall
  repository signature.

apt (1.2~exp1) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Automatic removal of debs after install ]
  After packages are successfully installed by apt(8),
  the corresponding .deb package files will be
  removed from the /var/cache/apt/archives cache directory.

  This can be changed by setting the apt configuration option
    "Binary::apt::APT::Keep-Downloaded-Packages" to "true". E.g:

  # echo 'Binary::apt::APT::Keep-Downloaded-Packages "true";' \
      > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01keep-debs

  Please note that the behavior of apt-get is unchanged. The
  downloaded debs will be kept in the cache directory after they
  are installed. To enable the behavior for other tools, you can set
  "APT::Keep-Downloaded-Packages" to false.

  [ Compressed indices ]
  If you use Acquire::gzipIndexes, or any other compressed index targets,
  those will now be compressed with the fastest supported algorithm,
  currently lz4.

apt (1.1~exp9) experimental; urgency=medium

  A new algorithm for pinning has been implemented, it now assigns a
  pin priority to a version instead of assigning a pin to a package.

  This might break existing corner cases of pinning, if they use multiple
  pins involving the same package name or patterns matching the same
  package name, but should overall lead to pinning that actually works
  as intended and documented.

apt (0.8.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * apt-get install pkg/experimental will now not only switch the
    candidate of package pkg to the version from the release experimental
    but also of all dependencies of pkg if the current candidate can't
    satisfy a versioned dependency.

apt (0.7.26~exp3) experimental; urgency=low

  * apt-ftparchive now reads the standard configuration files in
    /etc/apt/apt.conf and /etc/apt/apt.conf.d.

 -- Julian Andres Klode <jak@debian.org>  Fri, 26 Mar 2010 15:34:16 +0100

apt (0.7.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * Already included in the last version but now with better documentation
    is the possibility to add/prefer different compression types while
    downloading archive information, which can decrease the time needed for
    update on slow machines. See apt.conf (5) manpage for details.
  * APT manages his manpage translations now with po4a, thanks to Nicolas
    Fran√ßois and Kurasawa Nozomu, who also provide the ja translation.
    Thanks to Christian Perrier we have already a fr translation and
    a few more are hopefully added in the near future.
  * This version also introduces some _experimental_ configuration options
    to make more aggressive use of dpkg's triggers. If you want to help
    testing these _experimental_ options see apt.conf (5) manpage.

apt (0.7.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Code that determines which proxy to use was changed. Now
    'Acquire::{http,ftp}::Proxy[::<host>]' options have the highest priority,
    and '{http,ftp}_proxy' environment variables are used only if options
    mentioned above are not specified.

apt (0.6.44) unstable; urgency=low

  * apt-ftparchive --db now uses Berkeley DB_BTREE instead of DB_HASH. 
    If you use a database created by an older version of apt, delete 
    it and allow it to be recreated the next time.

 -- Michael Vogt <mvo@debian.org>  Wed, 26 Apr 2006 12:57:53 +0200

apt (0.5.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * apt-ftparchive --db now uses Berkeley DB version 4.2.  If used with a
    database created by an older version of apt, an attempt will be made
    to upgrade the database, but this may not work in all cases.  If your
    database is not automatically upgraded, delete it and allow it to be
    recreated the next time.
