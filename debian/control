Description: commandline package manager
 This package provides commandline tools for searching and
 managing as well as querying information about packages
 as a low-level access to all features of the libapt-pkg library.
 .
 These include:
  * apt-get for retrieval of packages and information about them
    from authenticated sources and for installation, upgrade and
    removal of packages together with their dependencies
  * apt-cache for querying available information about installed
    as well as installable packages
  * apt-cdrom to use removable media as a source for packages
  * apt-config as an interface to the configuration settings
  * apt-key as an interface to manage authentication keys

Description: package management runtime library
 This library provides the common functionality for searching and

 Higher-level package managers can depend upon this library.
 .
 This includes:
  * retrieval of information about packages from multiple sources
  * retrieval of packages and all dependent packages
    needed to satisfy a request either through an internal
    solver or by interfacing with an external one
  * authenticating the sources and validating the retrieved data
  * installation and removal of packages in the system
  * providing different transports to retrieve data over cdrom, ftp,
    http(s), rsh as well as an interface to add more transports like
    tor+http(s) (apt-transport-tor).
